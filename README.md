# MetropoliaWeatherApp

**Note: The project is no longer in development since March 2020. There are still bugs in the app since it never made it out of the beta phase, such as user preferences disappearing when the app is restarted. Unfortunately, we are too busy to fix them and it has been too long since we last touched it LOL.**

Our Weather App is an application that allows the user to determine whether the weather outside allows them to enjoy a "good day" or not.

What the application does is to receive weather data from online sources, compare the data to the user's preferences and display "It is a good day!" or "It is a bad day..." depending on the results.
