Our Weather App is an application that allows the user to determine whether the weather outside allows them to enjoy a "good day" or not.
Basically, what the app does is to receive weather data from online sources,
compare it to the user's preferences (can save multiple different preferences) and give a message:
"It is a good day" or "It is not a good day"
