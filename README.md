**Note: The project is no longer in development since March 2020. Although the project never made it out of the beta phase, which means that there are still lingering bugs that affect the UX, the application is overall usable.**

Our Weather App is an application that allows the user to determine whether the weather outside allows them to enjoy a "good day" or not.

What the application does is to receive weather data from online sources, compare the data to the user's preferences and display "It is a good day!" or "It is a bad day..." depending on the results.
